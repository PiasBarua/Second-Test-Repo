        <h4>History of Sweden Polytechnic Institute</h4>
        <p>It was established at Kaptai under Rangamati Hill Tracts in 1962 by the initiative of Swedish Government as Swedish-Pakistan Institute of Technology. After emergence of Bangladesh, the institute renamed as Bangladesh Sweden Polytechnic Institute. The total campus area is 30.95 acre.The Kaptai Dam was built by the Pakistan government (before the formation of Bangladesh) and financed by the United States government through USAID. The construction began in 1957 and was completed in about 6 years. About 666 meters long and 43 meters high, the dam was built on the Karnaphuli river in the heart of the Jumma Peoples’ land. Currently, the Kaptai Dam is the only hydropower source in Bangladesh, producing about 5% of the country’s electricity with an installed capacity of about 239 megawatts. While others reap the benefits of this destructive development project, the Jumma Peoples, who did not give consent to the project’s construction on their ancestral land, have experienced nothing but loss.</p>

        <p>The haunting displacement of the Jumma Peoples from their land is referred to by the Chakma people as the Bara Parang or the Great Exodus. They were given relief camps in India constructed in the “vacant lands” of Tirap, Lohit, and Subansiri districts of the erstwhile North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA), a political division governed by the Union government. In 1972, NEFA was renamed Arunachal Pradesh (AP) and made a Union Territory, and subsequently, it attained statehood. The locals and regional political parties opposed resettling refugees in their land fearing that it may change the demography of the state and that they may have to share their already limited resources. Since AP became a state, there were systematic attempts by AP to drive out the Kaptai displaced people settled in AP despite the Indian Supreme Court directives against the drive.</p>
