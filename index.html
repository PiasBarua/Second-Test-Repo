        <h4>History of Sweden Polytechnic Institute</h4>
        <p>It was established at Kaptai under Rangamati Hill Tracts in 1962 by the initiative of Swedish Government as Swedish-Pakistan Institute of Technology. After emergence of Bangladesh, the institute renamed as Bangladesh Sweden Polytechnic Institute. The total campus area is 30.95 acre.The Kaptai Dam was built by the Pakistan government (before the formation of Bangladesh) and financed by the United States government through USAID. The construction began in 1957 and was completed in about 6 years. About 666 meters long and 43 meters high, the dam was built on the Karnaphuli river in the heart of the Jumma Peoples’ land. Currently, the Kaptai Dam is the only hydropower source in Bangladesh, producing about 5% of the country’s electricity with an installed capacity of about 239 megawatts. While others reap the benefits of this destructive development project, the Jumma Peoples, who did not give consent to the project’s construction on their ancestral land, have experienced nothing but loss.</p>
